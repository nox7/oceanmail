# ðŸ“® OceanMail (v0.4.0) - Mail Exchange Server for PHP
OceanMail is a standalone PHP-coded mail exchange server that you can run on your own Linux servers to handle incoming emails in an object-oriented way.

This project hopes to remove boundaries of handling incoming emails such as having to use a 3rd party developer-friendly software (which requires payments) or giving up and just paying for GSuite/Microsoft mail.

OceanMail is aimed at developers who want to create their own inbox application or host an email server and perform custom logic (such as storing emails in an SQL database for easier management). Currently, most developers simply setup an ancient Postfix rig which revolves around confusing and outdated configuration formats. Even then, it isn't always clear how to setup exact configurations.

## âœ… Feature List
- Supports all incoming mail from EHLO or HELO mail clients on port :25
- Parses incoming mail into a workable PHP object for ease of use
- Verifies messages with DKIM signatures (completely checks bh and b signatures) using standalone code (no library!)
- Handles multipart data (such as attachments or text vs html parts)

## âš  Current Restrictions
The only known restriction is one of the PHP language itself - the inability to run code asynchronously. OceanMail will always be standalone in that all you need is the necessary ports open and CLI access to run your own mail server. We are aware of Swoosh and pthreads, but we will be hoping that the Fiber RFC passes or PHP eventually gains asynchronous function calling.

## ðŸ’» Running OceanMail
From a CLI interface, you simply run
```php
php server.php
```
Then the server loop is running. Any incoming mail will now be accepted (the default accepting port that mail clients always send to is :25).

You can also run the client.php script to test that mail is actually received when sent. Mailgun, GMail, Microsoft Outlook have also been tested and the server properly received and accepts mail from those applications as well as verifies the DKIMs.
```php
php client.php
```

## ðŸ•‹ How to Handle Incoming Mail
To add logic that can handle incoming mail (such as storing incoming mail in a database) you would do so in the `PostOffice.php` script and the method ``onMailDroppedOff()``. This method has a parameter for whenever a new Envelope (the incoming mail) is packaged and parsed.

### Reading the Address of A New Envelope
For instance, if your mail server wanted to make sure mail was delivered to the desired account, OceanMail has parsed the email address for you to extract the account from the email format (account@example.com). Here is an example of getting the recipients (because emails can be addressed to multiple accounts) of an Envelope
```php
$mail = ...; // The envelope object
foreach ($mail->parsedDataHeaders->to as $addressData){
  print($addressData->account . "\n");
}
```

The example output of an Envelope that was addressed to account1@example.com and hello@example.com would be
```
account1
hello
```

## Reading Headers From an Envelope
You can read any header from an Envelope using `::getDataHeader()` like so
```php
$bccs = $mail->getDataHeader("bcc");
```
If a header **does not exist**, then an empty string is returned.

## Check If an Envelope Is multipart
To check if an envelope is a multipart (has multiple parts, such as text, html, or attachments like images or PDFs)
```php
$isMultipart = $mail->isMultipart();
```
## Get All Parts of an Envelope
Any envelope that is multipart (remember, envelopes can have multiple envelopes in them and so can their children), you can loop through their child parts using the ```Envelope::multiparts``` property. It is an array of other Envelopes, or an empty array
```php
foreach($mail->multiparts as $childEnvelope){
  print_r($childEnvelope->getDataHeader("content-type"));
  
  // Remember that even the childEnvelope could be multipart too!
}
```

You can check the content-type of the child envelope
```php
foreach($mail->multiparts as $childEnvelope){
  $contentType = $childEnvelope->getDataHeader("content-type");
  if ($contentType !== ""){
    if ($contentType === "text/html"){
      $messageBody = $childEnvelope->body;
      print($messageBody); // Prints the body of this text/html part
    }
  }
}
```

## Check the Result of the SPF Check on the Envelope
```php
print($mail->spfCheckResult);
// Can be "pass", "fail", "softfail", "permerror", "temperror", or "none"
```
You should never reject mail based on SPF, but you can lower the trust score of an envelope that fails an SPF check.

## Check Whether the Envelope Passed the DKIM Verification
DKIM signatures help you determine if the mail was modified in transit from the sender to your mail server. If a "pass" status is read, the mail was not modified and was securely sent to your mail server. If a "permfail" status is read, then you may need to check the reason for the permfail to determine if you should lower the quality score explicitly - or by how much.

For instance, a reason of "No DKIM signature" doesn't mean the message was modified, but it also doesn't mean it wasn't. Simply, the sending server never signed the message.
```php
// The dkimResults is an array with two indices
// "status"=> and "reason"=>
$dkimResults = $mail->dkimVerificationResults;
if ($dkimResult['status'] === "pass"){
  // Secure message
}elseif ($dkimResult['status'] === "permfail"){
  // Something is wrong. Check $dkimResult['reason'] for more info
}
```
